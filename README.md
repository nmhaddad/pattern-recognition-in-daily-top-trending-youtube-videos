## Abstract:
Our objective for this project is to provide YouTube content creators with a detailed trend analysis and probabilistic interpretation of what makes a top trending video on the platform in order to maximize the reach and quality of the creators’ content. In this report, we will discuss our initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the dataset, and three experiments using the metadata of daily top trending videos on YouTube. These experiments include learning and evaluating word embeddings using word2vec, two semi-supervised learning classification sub-experiments using natural language processing, and analysis of video thumbnails using unsupervised machine learning and computer vision. Our goal is to provide insight into what daily top trending YouTube videos have in common, dig into the details of what types of attributes have the greatest impact making predictions about different attributes, and discover new relationships in the data about content.
